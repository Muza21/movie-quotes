This website has two sides, one is for guests, and one is for users(admin).
Guests can only see quotes randomly and check all quotes of a movie by clicking the movie title. As for users(admin), they can do CRUD(create, read, update, delete) operations as well.
The quotes can be seen randomly by refreshing the main page.
The users can register only by the terminal. for further information please check [getting started](#getting-started).
